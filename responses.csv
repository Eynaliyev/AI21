        Question:
        ```
        I'm building a solar power installation and I need help         working out the financials. 
        - Land costs $100 / square foot
        - I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
        - I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost         me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square         foot
        What is the total cost for the first year of operations         as a function of the number of square feet.
        ``` 
        Student's solution:
        ```
        Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
        Costs:
        1. Land cost: 100x
        2. Solar panel cost: 250x
        3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
        Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000

        I'm building a solar power installation and I need         help working out the financials. 
        - Land costs $100 / square foot
        - I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
